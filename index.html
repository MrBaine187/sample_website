    <h1>Learn Enough to be Dangerous</h1>
        <p>
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <br>
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take <br>
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes <br>
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, <br>
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. <br>
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from <br>
        learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our <br>
        movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

This page is part of the sample site for <br> <a href="http://learneough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn enough HTML to be dangerous</em></a>which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage,<br> the universal language of the World Wide Web.

    <h2>Founders</h2>
        <p>
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee <br>
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical <br>
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit <br>
        <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
      <p>
          Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
          Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
          <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
          introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
          <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
          plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
          are slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
      <p>
              When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
      <p>
                  You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
          Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
          at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
          tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
